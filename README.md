## 🔬 Project Overview
Developed a bioinformatics pipeline in R to identify mutation hotspots within bacterial DNA sequences, applying statistical analysis and machine learning to model evolutionary impacts on antibiotic resistance.

## 📂 Project Documentation

- **Code:** All analysis scripts and pipelines are available in the main repository, under [Code.R](Code.R)

- **Data:** All genomic sequences (FASTA) and annotation feature (GFF) datasets were harvested from the NCBI database and imported into R. Genomes utilised consisted of ASM676v1 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain: PAO1)) and ASM35950v1 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain: B136-33))
